/*
Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of "L" and
"R" characters. Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum
amount of balanced strings. Return the maximum amount of splitted
balanced strings
Example 1:
input: "RLRRLLRLRL"
output: 4
Explanation: "RLRRLLRLRL" can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL",
since each substring contains the same number of "L" and R"
Example 2:
input: "RLLLLRRRLR"
output: 3
Explanation: "RLLLLRRRLR" can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR","LR",
since each substring contains the same number of "L" and "R"
Example 3:
input: "LLLLRRRR"
output: 1
Explanation: "LLLLRRRR" can be split into "LLLLRRRR"
Example 4:
input: "RLRRRLLRLL"
output: 2
Explanation: "RLRRRLLRLL" can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL",
since each substring contains the same number of "L" and "R"
