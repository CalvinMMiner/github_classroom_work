/*
Remove duplicate letters in a string.
Givin a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal 
consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
Example 1
input: "xyyxzx"
output: "zx"
Exaplanation: In "xyyxzx", the first round removeal is "yy".
After "yy" has been removed, the string is "xxzx". Then, in the next round,
"xx" will be removed. "zx" is the final result.
