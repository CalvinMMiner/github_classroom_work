Code the following Haskell functions in a file named `Prog3.hs`. I've given you the starter code already. Complete these functions by replacing the line `error "undefined"` in them. _In your solution, you may define helper functions that are called by the original function._

If you cannot figure out one of the problems, do not remove the function, but leave it in as `error`.

**Sad news:** (or good news?): For each of the following, use list comprehension, and not recursion.

1. Write a function `absAll` that takes a list of ints, and returns a list of pairs, such that the first element in each pair is in the original number, and the second element is the absolute value of the original number.  
   `absAll :: [Int] -> [(Int, Int)]`
1. Write a function `flip'` that takes a list of pairs, and returns a list of pairs, with the pairs flipped (the first item becomes the second item, and vice versa).  
   `flip' :: [(Int, Int)] -> [(Int, Int)]`
1. Write a function `orderTriple` that takes a triple, and returns a version in decreasing order. (Hint: you may want to define other helper functions such as `maxOfThree`, `middleOfThree`, and `minOfThree`.)  
   `orderTriple :: (Integer, Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer, Integer)`
1. Write a function `asciiNums` that takes a String and returns a list of the ascii values of characters in that string.
   `asciiNums :: String -> [Int]`
1. Write a function `triads` that generates a list of integer triples, such that $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ and $x,y,z <= n$. (Hint: use a list comprehension with multiple generators.)  
   `triads :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]`
1. Write a function `sumLastPart` which, <u>only using list library functions (no list comprehension)</u>, returns the sum of the last $n$ numbers in the list, where n is the first argument to the function. (Assume that there are always at least $n$ numbers in the list. For this problem and the others, assume that no error checking is necessary unless otherwise specified. But feel free to incorporoate error checking into your definition if you would like.)  
   `sumLastPart :: Int -> [Int] -> Int`
1. Write a function `middleProduct` which, <u>only using list library functions (no list comprehension)</u>, returns the product of the interior items in the list, that is, everything except the first and last item. Assume there are always at least three numbers in the list.  
   `middleProduct :: [Int] -> Int`   
1. Write a function `init'` that has identical behavior to the `init` function. <u>In your definition, you may only use list library functions that we covered (no list comprehension).</u> And obviously, you may not use `init`.  
   `init' :: [Int] -> [Int]`
1. Write a function `lowerFirstCharacter` that lowercases the first character in a string. (If the first character is not an uppercase letter, return the entire string unmodified.)  
   `lowerFirstCharacter :: String -> String`  
1. Write a function `elemAt` that returns the ith item of the list, where the first item is index 1. <u>You may not use the `!!` Haskell function.</u> Hint: how can you utilize multiple generators?  
   `elemAt :: Int -> [Int] -> Int`
